##  About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m Juliet, a Frontend Web Developer and software engineering learner at the ALX program.  
I believe technology can drive meaningful change. My journey began with a fascination for how code shapes our world, and today Iâ€™m committed to leveraging digital tools to address pressing issuesâ€”especially those affecting our environment and food systems.

Iâ€™m particularly inspired by projects like **AgriPredict** and the **Zero Hunger** initiative, and I aspire to contribute to or replicate impactful solutions at the intersection of technology and sustainability.
